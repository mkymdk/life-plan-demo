# life-plan-demo
This repo serves as a financial planning application that provides personalized life plans based on input data. By entering information such as income, savings, expenses, investments, and loans, users can simulate future income and expenditure scenarios. The flexibility to set simulation periods and frequencies allows users to tailor plans to their lifestyle and goals. While currently not implemented, I am also exploring the possibility of utilizing personal information beyond financial data. ðŸŒŸðŸ’°
